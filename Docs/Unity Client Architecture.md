# Unity Client Architecture

## 1) Unity and C#
If you are new to either Unity or C#, and haven't already done so, at least do the "Interface and Essentials" and "Scripting" tutorials from here: http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials.  You need to be able to examine the Unity Console output and debug a running Unity project in Visual Studio.  You need to know enough C# to understand how events and callbacks work - these are used throughout the code.

## 2) SimpleJSON
To understand SimpleJSON, see examples here: http://wiki.unity3d.com/index.php/SimpleJSON.

## 3) Project structure

The diagram above gives an overview of the relationship between the different objects.

Communication between objects is all event driven.  Objects raise events and other objects listen to events that interest them, and react as needed.  This design lends itself well to dealing with the asynchronous nature of HTTP/OData calls - an OData call can be made, and then an event raised when the data comes back.  Any object interested in seeing that data can listen for the event, and then read the data.

All the interesting "PO box creation" stuff happens in the PoFactory class, which makes calls to the GameManager class to get the data it needs.  The key concepts come from understanding the relationship between these two objects.

### 3.1) GameManager
This is a singleton object, globally visible, and it provides the service of handling all HTTP/OData calls and provides nicely formatted data.  Other objects are "customers" of this service, and they use it like this:
* First they call GetEpmData_* to request some specific data, eg get a mass PO list or a single PO.
* The GameManager then makes an asynchronous call to get the data.  Once that data arrives, the GameManager raises the event On\*DataChanged to say "hey! data has arrived, you can come get it now".
* Then the customer can call GetEpmResponse_* to get the actual data - and this is when the parsing happens.  Parsing is only done on demand.

The GameManager is totally separate from any in-game Unity GameObjects, it touches nothing in-game.  It is up to the PoFactory and ChartFactory objects to make any changes to in-game objects.  To see how this happens, we can look at the process from the "customer" side and take a look at the PoFactory class.

### 3.2) PoFactory
The PoFactory is a customer of the GamaManager service described above.  The PoFactory operates in two phases.  In phase one it gets a list of PO items to create (just the PO item keys).  Then in phase two, it loops through that list and gets more details for each PO, enough information to actually create that PO item as a Unity GameObject.

If you look inside the PoFactory class, you'll see this pattern:

#### a) Hook GameManager Events
In the Start() method, the PoFactory hooks (listens to) two events exposed by the GameManager:
```csharp
GameManager.Instance.OnSinglePODataWithItemsChanged += OnSinglePODataWithItemsChanged;
GameManager.Instance.OnMassListPOChanged += OnMassListPOChanged;
```
The above means that the PO factory will react to hearing the event "GameManager.Instance.OnMassListPOChanged" by calling this, which is what starts the process of creation:
```csharp
private void OnMassListPOChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
{
  //print("PoFactory has received event OnMassListPOChanged");
  CreateMassPos();
}
```
#### b) Ask GameManager to get data
Later in the Start() method, you'll see a call to DoProductionRun() which itself makes a call to the GameManager requesting the "mass list" of PO data (this is still phase one):

```csharp
// init the factory and spawn POs
_factoryState = FactoryState.Working;
_posCreatedSoFar = 0;
print("Po Factory is starting a production run");
GameManager.Instance.GetEpmData_MassListPO(DesiredPoItemCount);
```
#### c) Wait for results then get them
That last call in the code snippet above causes the GameManager to make an asynchronous HTTP/OData call.  If and when that call returns data to the GameManager, the GameManager will store that data (as an unformatted string) and raise the event OnMassListPOChanged.  If there is no internet connection, or something falls over, then the event OnMassListPOChanged might never be raised.

When the PoFactory hears "OnMassListPOChanged" it knows there is data to get, so it goes and gets it using this line you can see at the start of the method CreateMassPos():
```csharp
EpmPoDataMass poDataMass = GameManager.Instance.GetEpmResponse_MassListPO();
```
It is only at this point that the GameManager attempts to parse the string it is storing internally.  It is only here that the SimpleJSON code is used to try to break out the JSON string.

Now phase two beings, and it follows a very similar pattern.  The PoFactory makes repeated calls to the GameManager asking for more data on each PO one at a time.  The PoFactory class listens to the event being raised saying data is ready, and then creates the PO boxes in the game.

This is kicked off towards the end of the CreateMassPos() method using the Unity method Invoke() to form a kind of queue:
```csharp
// And we're off!! This will create each PO one by one
Invoke("AskForPoData", PoCreateDelayInSeconds);
```

## 4) Creation of POs and PO Items
The SHINE OData service provides PO line items.  The PO GameObject boxes that appear in the game are created one per PO header.  It is the CreateMassPos() method that takes the initial "mass PO list" and summarises it to PO header level, then arranges for a queue of further HTTP/OData calls to happen via method AskForPoData().  In AskForPoData() you can see this call:

```csharp
GameManager.Instance.GetEpmData_SinglePOwithItems(pok.Doc, 20);
```

It is only when the event "GameManager.Instance.OnSinglePODataWithItemsChanged" is raised saying that data is available from that call, that the actual PO can be created.

```csharp
private void OnSinglePODataWithItemsChanged(object sender, EventArgs e)
   {
      //print("PoFactory has received event OnSinglePODataWithItemsChanged");
      CreatePoWithItems();
   }
```


```csharp
private void CreatePoWithItems()
{
  //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  // Instatiate PO gameobject
  //-------------------------------------------------------------------------
  GameObject gParent = GameObject.FindWithTag("PoBucket");
  Vector3 spawnPosition = _posToCreate[_posCreatedSoFar].Pos; 
  Quaternion spawnRotation = _posToCreate[_posCreatedSoFar].Rot; 
  etc etc
```
